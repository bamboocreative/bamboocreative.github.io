### Opportunity
Tim Tadder is an exceptional advertising photographer with incredible international clients, his preference is to handle creative and art direction in addition to the photography on a project, utilizing external resources for compositing and retouching.

We love working with Tim, so anytime he calls to ask if we're up for a new project we always say "yes!"

{% include project-image-full.html class="" image=page.image-4 %}

### Solutions
Elevendy (Bamboo's high-end production arm) worked directly with the images Tim provided to enact his vision for the final pieces on two separate campaigns. 


{% include project-image-half.html text="<p>First, a series for Pelican Pro Gear phone cases. For this project we took the impeccably lit photo assets Tim provided and composited them together to match the background, inner phone image, and talent images together seamlessly. Once compositing was set, our retouchers took over to create the final work. Images were then handed back to Tim's client who handled all layout, design, and copy writing.</p><p>Next, a key image for Pelican Pro Gear waterproof luggage. Tim handled all project planning and photography on this image. Shot on a dry sunny day, the compositing for this one was quite involved to add all of the components and make them work with a dark stormy feel with added rain. Our expert compositors made this image a reality by finding the perfect elements to pull off the rainy day feel. Image was again handed back to the client for layout, design, and copy writing placement.</p>" image=page.image-9 class=" no-margin-bottom" %}

{% include testimonial.html text="\"Nice Work! I really like the netting inside the cargo door, the finish work on the plane and the interior of the engine - all of it - excellent. Overall, outstanding work!\"" credit="â€”Creative Director, Pelican Gear" class="quote-center dark" %}

# Outcomes
{: .center }

The national ad campaign that these images launched received numerous accolades including 4 Gold ADDY awards. The work has been featured in curated galleries on Behance, and on 500px.com. Tim was ecstatic about the results because his client was overjoyed. In the end we made quite a few people look good to their stakeholders with these images, and sometimes...that's what it's all about.
