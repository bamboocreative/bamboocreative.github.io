_No matter what industry a company is in, brand building is paramount._

In today’s marketing world, how can you help your brand gain visibility and traction within larger markets and reach out to ever-growing circles of customers? The short and sweet answer: go cross-industry.

Marketers need to be willing to think outside the box and come up with new ideas that work. As companies face down a digitally-connected, information-aware environment, they're finding the "tried and true" strategies don't always cut it.

Marketing play-books have added an essential new strategy that’s a game-changer. It’s the idea that big businesses and brands can collaborate with individual celebrities, influencers or big names in order to attract attention to their products and services and to their brand as a whole. This kind of collaboration is driving a lot of advancement in marketing for the digital age, where viewers want to see something they actually have interest in, rather than passively observing advertising material.

**Brands, Artists and Influencers: Spectacular Marketing Operations**

One way businesses generate attention (and so can you) is through partnering with musical artists or other well-known groups of people. For example, right now device maker [Samsung is using a high profile new release by hip-hop artist Jay-Z](http://buswk.co/14cqEpH) to create interest in its line of smart phone and mobile products.

These kinds of interactions help to build more natural kinds of brand outreach. They give a marketing campaign a face. And, importantly, both parties get something out of the deal. Musical artists get to burnish their own brands as they participate in the event-generated narratives that are likely to draw in many new potential customers, especially younger crowds.

Ford Motor Company provides another example of successful cross-industry marketing. In April, [Ford partnered with 100 influencers](http://bit.ly/14lGNsN) to promote the Fiesta line of cars. The content created for this program was leveraged to engage young twenty-somethings via the influencers’ social networks and also through the brand’s TV and print advertising. This shows great influencer content can also have legs beyond the social space.

**Setting Up Brand-Building Opportunities**

The biggest challenge in creating cross-industry relationships is simply inertia.

Often, businesses don’t have specific point people on board to come up with these ideas and initiate them. A marketing department may not have the resources to go beyond a simple content strategy, and a brand can suffer as a result. Bottom line, resources need to be there to support the kinds of investigation and legwork that create good partnerships and cross-industry campaigns.

These kinds of cross-industry collaborations are poised to change the way marketers reach out to mass crowds in a digital age where information is ubiquitous but interest is not.

_Brands have to stand out when it matters_.

Creative cross-industry branding can help evoke the desired feeling or response in an audience--an important and challenging goal in this media-saturated business world. Take steps to make your marketing relevant and engaging, and move your brand forward.
