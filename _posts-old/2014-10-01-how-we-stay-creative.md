Use traditional art tools like paint, oil, or textiles. Get handy by building something with wood or work out your green thumb by planting some edibles. This exercise can breathe new creative life into you.

We try to get up the hill as often as possible. But when I can't be there physically, I make sure my workspace represents this inspiration.

Hearing about the ideas, hurdles, victories, and outcomes for other teams inspires me to continue to think of new ideas and approaches to the obstacles that I am facing.

Similar to Googles 20% Time, I try and give myself time to work on side projects, learn something new, or just experiment. It doesn’t always lead to great revelation or even a ton of useful work, but it does keep my mind fresh and generally diverse.
