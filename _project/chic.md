##### Creative. Epic. Unique. Diverse. 

These are just some of the words that describe the CHIC Conference, a bigger-than-life event for students that takes place every 3 years in Knoxville TN. CHIC acts as a catalyst in studentsâ€™ lives, helping them see the big picture in life and inspiring them to dive deeper into their faith, together. 


Bamboo led the CHIC team through a multi-session, brand development process on-site. The information garnered there acted as a springboard for us to refine their brand, developing a creative strategy, and refresh their logo & identity.

Our design team was brought in to create a print package that will stand out in the mind of potential conference attendees. 

We continue to partner with CHIC by providing insight, strategy, and implementation surrounding their marketing and social presence.
