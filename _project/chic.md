### Opportunity
CHIC is an event that happens every 3 years. As they were preparing for their 2015 event they needed to attract a new audience that feels invested in the event and would register to attend.

This opportunity was even more important to the organization given the fact that the CHIC team had some internal confusion around the brand and story of the conference.

### Solutions
Bamboo launched a brand project with the CHIC team in order to help bring some cohesion and continuity to the story that is being told. The goal was to put solid language and tools in the hands of those that will be marketing the event. 

Bamboo also headed up the social media strategy and worked for the year leading up to the event to build an audience that was engaging with CHIC and ultimately was registered to attend the conference. 

Through this project we partnered with the CHIC team on several initiatives:

- Branding
- Communications Strategy
- Social Media Strategy and Execution
- Copy Writing
- Ad Design
- Content Strategy and Delivery

{% include testimonial.html text="\"Trust me on this, Bamboo Marketing has a bigger vision for your company, event, or organization than even you do...Yes, that’s right; they are cooler than all of us, more tech-savey than all of us, more in-touch with cultural trends than all of us, and know without a doubt how to move your mission and vision forward.  Without their involvement in your project you’ll likely only meet half of your goals.  I recommend you go with Bamboo instead.  Good luck.\"" credit="— Tim Ciccone, Youth Ministry Leader, Evangelical Covenant Church" class="quote-center dark no-margin-bottom" %}
