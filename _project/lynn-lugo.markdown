Lynn Lugo began her fashion career creating designs for the likes of Neiman Marcus and Barneys New York. When she discovered how much she enjoyed creating boutique wedding and bridal dresses, her business shifted to designing for these special occasions. In a very hands-on, experiential industry like weddings, she has succeeded even though her company exists almost entirely online. She came to Bamboo wanting to improve the user experience on her site and expand her unique product line. We tried to create a personalized, wedding shopping experience that presents the multitude of dress options that she offers. Since launch, we have also provided print design that was featured in Martha Stewart Weddings.
