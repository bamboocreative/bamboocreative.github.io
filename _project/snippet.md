### Opportunity
Readers and writers have always been looking to connect, but little was being done to allow that interaction within the digital book itself. With huge shifts occurring in the publishing spectrum, could you introduce a new format for storytellers that would appeal to today’s reader, with their limited attention spans and platform agnosticism?

Not one to shy away from gargantuan challenges, Bamboo took an original idea that kept floating around the office and ran it through their product development process usually reserved for outside clientele.

{% include project-image-half.html text="<h3>Solutions</h3><p>With the intent to delight readers and non-traditional writers, the Snippet project introduced a new publishing format that was based on three principles: short, rich and beautiful content. To take advantage of different learning styles, the reading experience—called a Snippet—integrated text and media together like never before. Authors could easily include photography and video to accompany their copy, as well as social media timelines—a first for the publishing industry. Readers could now tweet to the author or their own followers immediately after reading a savory blurb, without leaving the experience.</p>" image=page.image-3 class="" %}

#Outcomes

{% include project-image-half.html text="<p>From prototype to product release within a year, Snippet’s initial buzz grew, attracting not only media attention but also the local angel investment community. Chosen from hundreds of applicants, Snippet went through a 10-week acceleration program, culminating in a pitch for area investors. In the following months, the Snippet team was able to raise over half a million dollars.</p><p>On launch, Snippet App reached #6 on the iTunes chart for Top-Grossing apps in its reading category, and within a year, they had acquired nearly 30,000. Following up its success was an enterprise solution created for multiple Fortune 100 companies.</p>" image=page.image-4 class="" %}
