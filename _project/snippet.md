While we spend much of our time working with clients to develop and execute their individual strategies, we devote a portion of our time to cultivate our own ideas that can have impact in the world. 

We have a long running list of ideas, and if one keeps resonating, or if we repeatedly notice the same problem time and again, we devote resources to refine the idea. 

One such idea that nagged at us was the lack of innovation around books and reading. We consume media in a vastly different way than the traditional hardcover: portable, accessible, richer content, in a social atmosphere. Yet all digital publishing seems to be is simply transposing books onto a digital screen. 

Unsatisfied, we wanted to re-imagine what the experience would be like... to think outside the book. So we built it. From idea to prototype—and then product—we set out to change the way we share stories and ideas. 

Before we launched the Snippet reading app and publishing platform, Snippet was voted one of the top 10 most promising startups in Northern California by Velocity Ventures. A year later, nearly 25,000 customers consume and produce content on our platform.
