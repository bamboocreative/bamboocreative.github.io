In the Sacramento area, William Jessup University is the only accredited private university offering four-year bachelor’s degrees. Following a recent multi-million dollar expansion and the highest enrollment in its history, Bamboo was commissioned to capture this momentum and position WJU as an innovative leader in online technology.

##### We implemented this in a number of ways: 

We created a centralized media site as the new “digital center” for the university. 

Social: Engaging students, faculty and supporters in campaigns captured the excitement and energy building around the school’s growth and gave a message to rally around. Re-channeling their outreaches concentrated the community and fixed much of the previous fragmentation. Ongoing digital strategy and consultancy is providing WJU, now in its 75th year, a huge step-up in communicating and sharing their exceptional growth. 

Additionally, rebranding and re-packaging outlying programs and assets aligned them with the overall WJU brand: The School of Professional Studies received a complete program redesign, and Bamboo redesigned and launched the publication Jessup Magazine to help tell the incredible stories coming out of William Jessup University.
