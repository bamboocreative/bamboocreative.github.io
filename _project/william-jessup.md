In the Sacramento area, William Jessup University is the only accredited private university offering four-year bachelor’s degrees. Following a recent multi-million dollar expansion and the highest enrollment in its history, Bamboo was commissioned to capture this momentum and position WJU as an innovator in high education.

William Jessup University celebrated their 75th Anniversary this fall and in honor of this milestone, they dedicated an entire edition of their Jessup Magazine to telling this story. In 1939, determined to make a difference, the Jessup family started San Jose Bible College in the Bay with a couple dozen students and today their legacy continues in Rocklin as William Jessup University with well over 1,000 students. Here at Bamboo Creative, we took this compelling history and designed the nostalgic experience their readers would walk through upon receiving the magazine.

##### In addition to the Jessup Magazine, we implemented this new positioning in a number of ways:

We created a centralized media site as the new “digital center” for the university. 

Social: Engaging students, faculty and supporters in campaigns captured the excitement and energy building around the school’s growth and gave a message to rally around. Re-channeling their outreaches concentrated the community and fixed much of the previous fragmentation. Ongoing digital strategy and consultancy is providing WJU, now in its 75th year, a huge step-up in communicating and sharing their exceptional growth. 

Additionally, rebranding and re-packaging outlying programs and assets aligned them with the overall WJU brand: The School of Professional Studies received a complete program redesign, and Bamboo redesigned and launched the publication Jessup Magazine to help tell the incredible stories coming out of William Jessup University.
