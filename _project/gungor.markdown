It's a unique treat to have talented friends in the music industry—especially when they are three-time GRAMMY nominees and the creative beasts behind the distinct worship band, GÜNGÖR. After designing their critically acclaimed first record, Beautiful Things, in 2010, the band came calling again to create their packaging for their most recent live album. Dubbed "a creation liturgy", the design and art direction combines old (the lead singer's parents leading worship in a country church) with the new (including dozens of photos from the live tour).
