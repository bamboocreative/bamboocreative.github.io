In the Sacramento area, William Jessup University is the only accredited private university offering four-year bachelor's degrees. Following a recent multi-million dollar expansion and the highest enrollment in its history, Bamboo was commissioned to capture this momentum and position WJU as an innovative leader in online technology. 

We immediately saw a multitude of ways to do this. We created a centralized media site as the new "digital center" for the university. Social campaigns captured the excitement and energy building around the school's growth and gave students, faculty and supporters a message to rally around. Re-channeling their social media outreaches is concentrating the community and fixing much of the previous fragmentation. Ongoing digital strategy and consultancy is providing WJU a huge step-up in communicating and sharing their exceptional growth. Additionally, our rebrand and repackaging for the School of Professional Studies is underway to align that program with the overall WJU brand. 

We believe a strong message presented on a fresh platform increases both audience engagement and organization trajectory. A new look can breath new life. Bamboo brought its design expertise to the Jessup Magazine to help tell the incredible stories coming out of William Jessup University, which is coming up on its 75th anniversary.
