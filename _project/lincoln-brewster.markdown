Integrity Music recording artist, Lincoln Brewster, tapped Bamboo to design his latest record. For his 8th release, Shout for Joy, the former guitar prodigy and sought-after session player chose to produce his first set of Christmas songs. In designing his package, we wanted to capture the energy of his live electric-guitar playing using super-bold typography and his memorable profile image.
