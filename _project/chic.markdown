Creative. Epic. Unique. Diverse. These are just some of the words that describe the CHIC Conference, a bigger-than-life event for students that takes place every 3 years in Knoxville TN. CHIC acts as a catalyst in students’ lives helping them see the big picture in life and inspiring them to dive deeper in their faith together. Bamboo provided creative strategy around developing CHIC’s identity, logo refresh, and print design. We used our strategic muscle at multiple on-site creative sessions and brought in our visual expertise to create print design that will stand out in the mind of potential conference attendees. We continue to partner with CHIC by providing insight, strategy, and implementation surrounding their social presence.
