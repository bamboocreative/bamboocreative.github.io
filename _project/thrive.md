### Opportunity
Thrive Conferences was feeling the need to solidify its brand purpose and create an overarching brand structure that could encompass the many different conferences they put on.

### Solutions
We conducted market research and interviews to develop a brand brief that would help guide the different conferences to a common goal. Additionally we created a website for Thrive to both promote their conferences on as well as host a video library of conference talks.
