The American Bible Society (ABS) has been making the Bible available to people for the last 200 years. One way ABS continues to do this is through the ABS Atrium in New York, where interactive displays bring the Bible to life. 

ABS came to us, as it made plans for its newest exhibit. ABS partnered with top TV producer Mark Burnett and executive producer and actress Roma Downey to organize an exhibit which highlights the duo’s television production, THE BIBLE. This five-part miniseries retells some of the Bible’s best-known stories. We helped ABS design its displays by creating an interactive experience with exclusive behind-the-scenes footage, images and stories from the miniseries. 

[The Bible debuted on the History Channel](www.history.com/shows/the-bible) March 3, 2013, with 13.1 million total viewers, making it the top entertainment telecast on cable so far this year.
