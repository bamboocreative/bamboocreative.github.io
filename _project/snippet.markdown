With the way technology and media have changed, we were surprised to see the lack of innovation around books and reading. We are consuming media in a vastly different way than the traditional hardcover, yet the mentality for digital publishing seems to be simply transposing books onto a digital screen. We were definitely not satisfied. From writing to reading, we wanted to re-imagine what the experience would be like... to think outside the book. So we built it. From idea to prototype—and now to a product—we're out to change the way we share stories and ideas.
