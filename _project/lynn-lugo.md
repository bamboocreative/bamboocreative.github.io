Lynn Lugo began her fashion career creating designs for the likes of Neiman Marcus and Barneys New York. When she discovered how much she enjoyed creating boutique wedding and bridal dresses, her business shifted to designing for these special occasions. 

In the very hands-on, experiential wedding industry, where most vendor and client interactions are face-to-face, Lynn has succeeded even though her company exists almost entirely online. She came to Bamboo wanting to improve the user experience on her site and expand her unique product line. 

We created a personalized, wedding shopping experience that presents the multitude of dress options that she offers. We have also provided print design that was featured in industry leading publication, _Martha Stewart Weddings_.
