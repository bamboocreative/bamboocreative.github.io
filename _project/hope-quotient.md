Ray Johnston has a rich and varied background that touches everything from university professor, speaker, writer, and founder of Thrive communications and conferences. When he decided to launch his new book _The Hope Quotient_, he called on Bamboo Creative to parter with him and develop a new website.

This new site is the hub for all information about this exciting book and new method for gauging and increasing your level of hope. On this website, people are able to purchase the book, access valuable resources, and log-in to complete their Hope Quotient assessment test.
