From chile rellenos to tacos del mar, Zocalo knows authentic Mexican fare. Their lively ambiance features dishes and decor influenced by the lively town squares of Mexico. With multiple locations and growing rapidly, this restaurant boasts rave reviews from fans and area media outlets alike. 

Desiring to provide their customers with a visual experience as savory as their entrees, Zocalo relies on Bamboo for design and social strategy. We captured it through key art and original photography, which displays prominently on their beautifully designed web and mobile presence. Now people can drool over the menus and be struck by their style, anytime and anywhere.
