The Hub considers itself _the_ shop for anyone and everyone who loves bikes. Frustrated with the cliques that form between road, mountain and family bikers, they wanted to build a new kind of community without barriers between different types of customers. To encourage this, we created a social media strategy with campaigns to bring all of their different clientele together around cycling and The Hub.
