### Opportunity
Ubisoft makes badass games and needs Key Art and advertising campaign ideas to help boost game sales. The marketing, game covers, and other visuals for these games need to authentically appeal to a wide variety of player personas while not alienating potentially conflicting buyers.

### Solutions
Elevendy (Bamboo's high-end production arm) employed a mix of our design-thinking methodology, brand development, and implementation tactics to drive significant results to Ubisoft's internal marketing team.

They are that awesome!\"" credit="-Brian Tippie, Associate Creative Director - Ubisoft" class="quote-center" %}

#### 360 degree advertising campaign development
The Elevendy team was heavily involved in multiple client-led ideation meetings to identify and develop campaign themes, strategies, and creative executions of every aspect of the pending campaigns. Beyond those meetings we assisted with pitch deck design, campaign element creation on spec, tv spot copywriting, tv spot storyboards, and large OOH experience design

#### Key Art
From ideation and conceptualization through development and creation, the Elevendy crew worked from pitch to final art on multiple AAA titles. Often including 3D/CG Modeling, posing, lighting, rigging, rendering, and finishing. Photoshoots including hair, makeup, and wardrobe, and insanely high-level retouching and compositing.

# Outcomes

During our time working with Ubisoft, we helped their internal marketing department win key pieces of business for a bevy of titles like Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Blacklist, Assassin's Creed 3/4/5, Spartacus: Legends, Tom Clancy's The Division, ZombiU, FarCry 4, and others.

In addition, the images we produced for the special box set of Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Blacklist Limited Edition won the prestigious "Best Cool S***" award at the 2014 GMS Awards.
