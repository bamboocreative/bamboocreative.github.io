Recording artist and touring musician, Lincoln Brewster, tasked Bamboo to come alongside and provide bold creative support and platform-building strategy. 

From album design to tour collateral, to interactive web and social campaigns, our goal is to capture the energy of his live electric-guitar sound, utilizing ultra-bold typography and his memorable profile image.

For his latest release on Integrity Music, Oxygen, our creative team delivered the album story in some new ways. We produced an intimate series of behind-the-scenes videos and commissioned writers to tell the different song stories, and produced a rich, interactive digital book on the Snippet platform.
