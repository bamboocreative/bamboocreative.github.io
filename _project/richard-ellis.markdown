Richard Ellis, radio personality and pastor of Reunion Church, is always giving valuable advice, insight and encouragement through his talks on a variety of subjects. Richard wanted to connect with his audience, make useful resources available to them and invite conversation by establishing an online presence. At Bamboo Creative, we were able to provide everything he needed to get started. First, we helped him pick a name and create a logo design that would reflect the personality and mission of his online resources. Then, we built a sleek website with a bold look. To give him multiple ways to connect with his audience and share his expertise, we also got him set up on social media and provided strategy on how to best use each profile. Thus, Richard Ellis Talks was born.
