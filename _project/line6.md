**Line 6, an industry-leading company continually introduces innovative audio products to musicians and technologists.** When they decided to update their website, they approached Bamboo Creative for our design leadership. Considering their wide selection of products and their varied audiences, we designed a beautiful and bold new look for them to set them on a new trajectory as they launch new and innovative products.

After designing Line 6's new website, Line 6 approached Bamboo Creative to design their new nurture marketing campaigns for some of their innovative products such as AMPLIFi, a revolutionary new bluetooth-enabled cloud-synced amp system, among other products. 

[Each of these campaign consists of a series of emails, landing pages and digital ads.](#) Bamboo Creative designed a beautiful storytelling experience that highlights the Line 6 products and their benefits.
