As one of the largest churches in Northern California, Bayside is an extremely fluid and dynamic organization, managing multiple site locations with dozens of departments and an executive team that is consistently planning and executing major community outreach efforts. 

In our many years as a creative partner, Bamboo Creative has helped this organization carry out extremely lofty goals and been amazed at the community and world impact that our communication strategy and technological solutions have been able to achieve.  

Some of the different ways we have worked together: 

* craft marketing and communications plans
* create visual identity for outreach efforts
* manage and support internal communication channels
* build web applications to manage thousands of events, admins and users 
* content strategy and social media management 

Growth into additional campuses necessitated a complete web site redesign. Bamboo instituted a new site structure and navigation to bring equal recognition to all of the Bayside Campuses, and localized content strategy harmonizes the way people make a Bayside Church location their home. Additionally, we integrated technological features in the admin sections to improve daily workflow for the many people involved in updating the site.
