As Thrive Conference continued to grow, they needed a website that would stand out among Christian leadership conferences the way the conference itself already does. Enter Bamboo Creative. We incorporated conference footage to capture the level of excitement attendees experience during the main sessions. We then used every available pixel to convey Thrive's vision of refreshing and renewing individuals both with bright graphics and an encouraging and powerful blog.
