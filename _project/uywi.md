### Opportunity
Urban Youth Workers Institute was on the brink of needing to shut their doors. They needed a solid direction and vision if they were going to launch into the next season for their organization.

The UYWI team needed support in creating ideas and a strategy to grow their national conference attendance, increase donors, and tell their brand story.

### Solutions
Bamboo guided the UYWI team through a branding process that helped define and solidify their story. Through this process they were able to gain language and focus that changed the way that they talk about their organization and why they exist. 

{% include project-image-half.html text="<p>We also worked with their team to build the UYWI APP. This is the hub for their content distribution and was created to provide a way for UYWI to offer valuable content to every youth worker that is connected to their organization.</p><p>The UYWI Conference team partnered with us to market and fill their National Conference through email campaigns and social media management. The Bamboo team was onsite for their event and provided realtime social media coverage. </p>" image=page.image-3 class="" %}
