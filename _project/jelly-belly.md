### Opportunity
Jelly Belly needed a strong visual campaign to push to their international audience. Due to the challenges of translation, these images would need to convey the true-to-life real fruit flavor of Jelly Belly Jelly Beans, without relying on words.

An additional challenge to this was the fact that Jelly Belly Jelly Beans have grown stale in the way the brand is represented visually, we were asked to help them break out of the "jelly beans on white" style that was previously employed.

### Solutions
Elevendy (Bamboo's high-end production arm) developed an array of visual campaign directions, before ultimately landing on the splash-juice concept. Our team went further to provide ad copywriting for an eventual campaign to run domestically.

#### High level concepts and art direction
The Elevendy team offered 6 unique concepts that all played on the whimsical fruit flavored aspects of their products. Through multiple pitch and revision rounds the final concept was chosen that would fit as an evolutionary change to this established brand.

#### Art Creation
We performed in-house composite work and international level retouching, utilizing client assets, stock images, and studio images shot in-house as necessary. Because of the detailed nature of what we were trying to accomplish, no attention to detail was spared. Our crack team of eagle-eyed finishers ensured every drop was unique, every angle correct, and all lighting was matched to the source. After all, it's the little things that make the difference.

#### Professional copywriting
For Jelly Belly's domestic market, we provided copy writing for an eventual ad campaign that would play off of the whimsical style presented in the images and ensure we kept a sense of fun for which the brand has become known.

# Outcomes

The first series of images was so wildly loved a second set of images for a follow-up campaign were requested. Both are shown on this page. Brand understanding in foreign countries has had a measurable improvement.
