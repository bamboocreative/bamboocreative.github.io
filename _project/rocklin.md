Rocklin, CA is a beautiful, suburban city on the outskirts of Sacramento. Residents are quick to boast of the safe, friendly neighborhoods and the regionâ€™s best educational offerings, however, when asked to describe the city, they are hard-pressed to find an answer. It's also a city that is facing build-out in the next 15 to 20 years. In order to define the city's story as well as make the most of this season, Bamboo Creative partnered with the City of Rocklin to walk through a very comprehensive strategic branding process. 

Our multi-phase process starts with the Research and Audit Phase. Our priority during this phase is to listen, both to the City itself and all of it's audience through of methods and interactions. We also listened to the City from the perspective of someone new to the area via its current marketing and communication pieces. What story was it currently telling? And does this story convey all that Rocklin has to offer?

After delivering our research and conclusions, we began the Development Phase. Bamboo Creative's creative brain trust then pulls together all the findings from the Research as well as the strategic session we host with city leaders. From there, we distill, distill and distill the data some more. It's at this point that we can plot the course of the story that emerges and from there craft the different components that form the City's brand.

Once the brand is formed, it informs what everyone will see and experience from the city. We call this phase Implementation: it consists of the logo, the new look and feel, as well as a valuable and actionable guide for bringing this new story to life.
