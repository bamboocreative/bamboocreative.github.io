In our experience developing publishing solutions, we have heard many of the pain points and challenges that aspiring authors and writers have. Even for a traditionally-published author, the landscape has changed so much that they are constantly searching for ways to make their book marketing more effective.

We created Booklaunch.io as a simple, beautiful way to create a book marketing page. Incorporating author-friendly features such as drag-and-drop imagery, media integration, email capture in a completely code-free experience, writers could start promoting a title in a fraction of the time it would take to solicit a designer.
