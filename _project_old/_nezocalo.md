### Opportunity
As Zocalo began growing to multiple locations it was clear that they needed a cohesive brand that enabled them to accurately tell their story.

This story needed to be told through updated web and social media presences that reflected their true brand, and enabled them to communicate clearly with their audience.

### Solutions
Bamboo launched a brand project with the Zocalo team in order to help bring some cohesion and continuity to the story that is being told. The goal was to put solid language and tools in the hands of those that lead this restaurant.  Bamboo also created a new website and headed up the social media strategy to help build their online presence into something clear, cohesive, and effective.

{% include testimonial.html text="\"As our restaurant started to expand into more locations, we needed to get a better handle on our brand and ensure that we could continue growth. We needed new ideas so we turned to Bamboo. They're branding work not only helped us refine our external message but also provided the internal focus and clarity that had eluded us for years. We needed to believe in ourselves again. Sales are up. Morale is up and we're more excited about the future than ever before!\"" credit="-Ryan Rose, Executive Chef, Zocalo" class="quote-center dark no-margin-top" %}

#### Symbol Design
With a capable resource in mind, we designed a shield in 3D that would be created by a local artisan from our design elements. This shield served as both an internal and external point of solidarity around the new brand story.

# Outcomes

During our time working with Zocalo we were able to help them establish a brand story that effected every part of their organization. From their menu, and uniforms, to the decor and equipment- every aspect of the Zocalo experience was changed.
