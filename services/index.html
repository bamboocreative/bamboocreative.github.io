				<h3>Branding</h3>
				<p>This is about more than logos or slogans. Through our 3-phased approach, we test internal assumptions against real data, find your organization's purpose, develop a compelling and authentic story, and deliver real-world implementation ideas to help you live out your brand.</p>

				<h3>Design Thinking</h3>
				<p>We love executing beautiful ideas in beautiful ways. Our design thinking methods ensure that the messaging, design, stories, and interactions we help our clients develop are done so with empathy and an ability to truly connect with audiences on an emotional level.</p>

				<h3>Implementation</h3>
				<p>A great brand, concept, or strategy is literally worthless if it never makes it onto the streets. This is where real-world tactics come into play. In-house pros help our clients live out their vision in any medium necessary â€“ from creative strategy, to web and app design/development, print design, social media strategy, advertising, and more.</p>

				<h3>Development</h3>
				<p>We practice what we preach, challenging ourselves to not only dream up big ideas, but implement them as well. This is our sandbox, and where many of the "lessons learned" impact and benefit our clients on a daily basis. Innovation, agile strategy, rapid prototyping... it's how we keep coming up with our own products like Booklaunch, Snippet, Presslaunch and Brand Camp.</p>
