Which is better: having a goal or having a system? According to Scott Adams, creator of the comic strip Dilbert and author of 9 books, the answer is definitely having a system. 

### Systems vs Goals
In his book How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big: Kind of the Story of My Life, Scott Adams describes goals and systems this way: 
	“…goals are a reach-it-and-be-done situation, whereas a system is something you do on a regular basis with a reasonable expectation that doing so will get you to a better place in your life. Systems have no deadlines, and on any given day you probably can’t tell if they’re moving you in the right direction.”

When you set a goal, you’re starting a project that has clear parameters for success and failure. If you choose to lose 20 pounds but don’t follow through, you’ve failed. Systems, however, are not so defined – they focus on process instead of outcome, helping you put yourself in a position for success. 

### People Who Succeed Follow Systems
In our weight loss example, skipping dessert and exercising everyday is a system. You probably wouldn’t be able to tell on a daily basis whether your system is working, but over time you’ll see yourself making progress. 
Scott Adams describes his choice to start a blog in the same terms. He explains that he looked at his blog – a task that took up half his work time while only providing about 5% of his income – as a system. Blogging was a way to experiment with writing styles, find what resonates with his readers, and open up new opportunities. And it worked! While Adams’ success couldn’t be seen on a day-to-day level, his blog indeed led him to new opportunities and proved his system effective. 

### Molding Systems Around Energy
Your ability to make your systems work depends more on the amount of energy you have (and how you harness it) than the amount of time you put in. Adams describes being at his peak energy in the morning, so he reserves this time to draw. The afternoon he uses for busy work. Use this same concept to create a schedule that matches your energy levels to get the most out of every working moment and set up systems primed for success.
