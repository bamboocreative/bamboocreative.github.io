Dear friends,

This year has been an incredible year for Bamboo Creative. It's hard to believe we're approaching a full year of being in business. As I reflect on the last 10 months, I want to thank you all for giving us the opportunity to serve you and join you in your business ventures. Our success is directly related to our spectacular clients. Thank you.

There is nothing but anticipation and excitement for 2013. We expect to launch our highly anticipated app Snippet which recently was named "One of the Top 10 promising products in Northern California" by Velocity Ventures. Snippet was featured in Business Journal, Sac Bee as well as on Capital Public Radio. We believe Snippet will add incredible value to our customers and to the mass market. Snippet will be available on iOS devices by the end of January.

We also are constantly seeking to bring on the brightest and most creative individuals to our team. The life blood of Bamboo are the creative people in it and I can't wait to share them with you.

On behalf of the whole team at Bamboo Creative, we want to wish you and your families a Happy New Year. Let's make this next year an incredible one! God Bless.

CJ  
CEO & CoFounder
