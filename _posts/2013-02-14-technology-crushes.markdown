We spend our time and money on them. We could stare at them for hours. To maintain a close, healthy relationship, we always keep them updated. We all have one, a technology crush - a program, app or piece of tech we love. The Bamboo team members share the technologies that set their hearts aflutter:

##What’s your technology crush?

###Kenny
> I love me some [Spotify](http://spotify.com/) Premium, there’s nothing like getting some sweet melodies right at the touch of my iPhone!

###Jake
> I'm crushing on [Uber](http://uber.com/) these days. Last time in SF, I created an account and dropped a pin. Within 30 seconds, a private car showed up and took us to our destination; I got out and walked away, never had to take out my wallet! Uber's app handles everything that I hate about taxis and does it with such class and style. Best thing yet, they just started test rides closer to home in Sacramento.

###Ben
> iPad Mini… Crushing hard for this sexy aluminum beast. I feel somewhat guilty for checking out the greener grass. My now oversized, cumbersome iPad2 sadly lays idle, as I strain my neck to check out her slimmer, younger cousin around the office. Once, I actually put my hands on her; it was over. Sometimes, I just put her in my pocket and walk around—just because I can. She will be mine, someday.

###Josh
> My technology crush is [Google](http://google.com/). I know people say that you can't trust them, that Google has no idea what privacy is, and that someone so focused on data would never have time for a relationship, but Google has changed. The data-driven brute has become a 21st century Da Vinci; from the modest grays to the striking fonts and product-wide design, Google's got the looks to match the brawn and brains.

###Ginny
> I'm currently crushing on [iThoughtsHD](http://www.ithoughts.co.uk/iThoughtsHD/) for iPad. It understands me. My thoughts and plans don't always come to me in linear fashion - why should my notes reflect that they do? Best of all, it cares that I'm left-handed!

###Emily
> My technology crush is [Instagram](http://www.instagram.com/) . It’s the perfect blend of vintage flair and modern social trends. I love taking it for long walks on the beach, especially when the lighting is just right.

###CJ
> My iPad mini. She's simple, intelligent and well dressed.

###Garrett
> This year, my technology crush is the music Streaming app [Rdio](http://www.rdio.com/). They make it easy to discover and share new music, and they've got the most beautiful interface you've ever seen. Plus, they have like every Smashmouth song.
