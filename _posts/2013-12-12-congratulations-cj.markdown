The winners were selected by a panel of independent judges and have incredibly impressive resumes. They range from lawyers and educators, to health care providers and high-tech entrepreneurs.

In addition to his leadership at Bamboo Creative and **[The Snippet App](http://www.thesnippetapp.com/)**, CJ donates time each week to work with college students interested in business and media. He’s also participated in developing a local business incubator aimed at helping entrepreneurs 25 years old and younger launch their own businesses.
