We're excited to announce that five interns have joined the Boo Crew for the summer. This talented group is passionate about design, web development, marketing and social media. Each "Bootern" brings something unique to the table, forming a team with a variety strengths and fresh perspectives.

This summer, we'll guide the Booterns through a multifaceted branding and marketing project. They'll work together to provide a local nonprofit with the tools and resources needed to build, strengthen and grow its brand. The Booterns will be blogging about the process and what they've been learning throughout the summer. You can follow them on Tumblr to stay updated!

We've already been impressed by the teachability, eagerness and initiative of these interns, and we can't wait to share our expertise with this bright group--and learn a few things ourselves. Now, get ready to meet the Booterns. Here's how they would describe themselves in 140 characters or less:
