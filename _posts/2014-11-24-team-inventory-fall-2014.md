This year we are so thankful for the team we have here at Bamboo. From executive meetings and drawing boards to [waffle making](http://instagram.com/p/vrdlsLGG6D/) and [ping pong](http://instagram.com/p/mn68C8GG8I/), we stick together. We took a little time this past week to take an inventory of our team and reflect on where we are in this season.
