# Scale

Innovation has become all all the rage. Everyone is either innovating, needing to innovate, or currently ramping up to innovate. The problem is, while we’re all talking about the same word we all don’t mean mean the same thing. And that is creating a huge problem.  

### Innovation requires a sense of scale.

Two guys chat in a coffee shop. While waiting for their drink, they strike up a conversation about basketball.  They both express their love for the game.

One guy says “I play basketball every week”

The other says “So do I!”

“I love the jump shot” The first man proclaims

“Oh yeah? I’m point guard and love to take in to the hoop” says the second.

By the conversation both seem to be avid players. So, one day they play a game with friends.
One played for the NBA and other had just started playing to get in better shape, and *it wasn't until they really started playing the game that the disparity between the two was made visible.*

They both use the same vocabulary. But their ideas of what “playing basketball” really meant was completely different.  

When we’re merely talking about innovation, it’s easy to think we’re talking about the same thing. Everyone has read the same blogs and books, watched the same TED talks.
The problem arises when you are actually doing the work. To be effective, we all need to be on the same page.

_There is a gap between what we all say about innovation and what we’re actually capable of and comfortable with._

So get on the same page, communicate. And make sure everyone is aligned with the goal.
